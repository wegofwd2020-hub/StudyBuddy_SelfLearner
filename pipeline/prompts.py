_FORMATTING_GUIDELINES = """FORMATTING RULES (apply to all string-valued content fields):

Markdown syntax is ALLOWED inside content string values. The rule against
markdown fences applies ONLY to the outermost JSON response envelope.

TABLES — use GFM markdown tables whenever content is tabular by nature:
  - Comparisons with 2+ attributes
  - Chronologies and timelines
  - Side-by-side concept contrasts
  - Any numeric data set where rows share the same columns
Include column-alignment markers in the separator row:
  | Name | Amount | Description |
  |:-----|-------:|:------------|
  | Cash | 1,500  | Liquid asset |
Left-align text (`:---`), right-align numbers (`---:`), centre headings
(`:---:`). Right-align any monetary or numeric column.

MATHEMATICAL FORMULAE — use LaTeX delimiters:
  - Inline math inside prose: $E = mc^2$
  - Display math on its own line: $$\\int_a^b f(x)\\,dx$$
Use this for all equations, inequalities, fractions, subscripts,
superscripts, Greek letters, and any expression that benefits from typeset
rendering. Do NOT write raw "E = mc^2" as plain text — it will not render.

DOLLAR SIGN AS CURRENCY — escape or spell out to avoid math-mode collisions:
  - Write \\$150.00 (backslash-escaped) inside prose, OR
  - Spell out the currency code: "USD 150.00", "INR 1,200", "EUR 42.50".
Never use an unescaped $ outside a math expression.

SCIENTIFIC NOTATION:
  - In inline prose, Unicode superscripts are fine: "1.6 × 10⁻¹⁹ C".
  - In display equations, use KaTeX: $$1.6 \\times 10^{-19}\\,\\mathrm{C}$$.

FENCED CODE BLOCKS — use for pseudocode, algorithms, and program listings:
  ```python
  def area(r):
      return 3.14159 * r * r
  ```

ATTRIBUTED QUOTES — you MAY include short attributed quotes from
historical figures (scientists, mathematicians, authors) when they frame
or reinforce the lesson. Use markdown blockquote syntax with an em-dashed
attribution on its own line:

  > Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed.
  > — James Prescott Joule

Rules:
  - Only quote widely-documented, verifiable statements. When in doubt,
    paraphrase instead of quoting.
  - NEVER invent paper titles, book titles, DOIs, URLs, or citation
    metadata. No "Smith, J. (2019)" style references.
  - Do NOT quote living people or recent (post-2000) sources — stick to
    established historical figures whose quotes are well-attested.
  - Keep quotes under 25 words. If a passage needs more, paraphrase.
  - Attribution line starts with "— " (em dash + space), then the
    speaker's name only. No role, no date, no source title.
"""


# ── Per-subject guidelines (Epic 11 C-2) ─────────────────────────────────────
# Injected in addition to the universal block. Subject names are matched
# case-insensitively against canonical groupings — unknown subjects fall
# through to the empty string (no-op).

_COMMERCE_GUIDELINES = """SUBJECT-SPECIFIC — COMMERCE (Accountancy / Business Studies / Economics):

Financial statements — ALWAYS render as markdown tables with right-aligned
numeric columns. Templates:

Balance Sheet example:
| Item | Amount (INR) |
|:-----|-------------:|
| Cash and Cash Equivalents | 50,000 |
| Accounts Receivable       | 30,000 |
| Inventory                 | 20,000 |
| **Total Current Assets**  | **100,000** |

Profit & Loss statement example:
| Line Item | Amount (INR) |
|:----------|-------------:|
| Revenue             | 500,000 |
| Cost of Goods Sold  | (300,000) |
| **Gross Profit**    | **200,000** |

Trial Balance example:
| Account | Debit | Credit |
|:--------|------:|-------:|
| Cash             | 50,000 |        |
| Accounts Payable |        | 30,000 |

Cash Flow statement: three sections — Operating, Investing, Financing —
each rendered as its own table. Use parentheses (300,000) for negative
values, bold rows for subtotals and totals. Always spell out currency
(INR / USD / EUR) — never unescaped $.

Accounting equations render as KaTeX:
  $$\\text{Assets} = \\text{Liabilities} + \\text{Equity}$$
  $$\\text{Gross Profit Margin} = \\frac{\\text{Gross Profit}}{\\text{Revenue}} \\times 100\\%$$
"""


_SCIENCE_GUIDELINES = """SUBJECT-SPECIFIC — NATURAL SCIENCES (Physics / Chemistry / Biology):

Formulae and equations — ALWAYS in KaTeX, never raw text.
  Physics: $$F = ma$$, $$E_k = \\tfrac{1}{2}mv^2$$, $$\\lambda = \\frac{h}{p}$$
  Chemistry: balanced equations via `\\ce{}` or arrow notation:
    $$2\\mathrm{H}_2 + \\mathrm{O}_2 \\rightarrow 2\\mathrm{H}_2\\mathrm{O}$$
  Biology: kinetic and equilibrium expressions as display math.

Reaction mechanisms / stoichiometry — tables:
| Reactant | Coefficient | Product | Coefficient |
|:---------|:-----------:|:--------|:-----------:|
| H₂       | 2           | H₂O     | 2           |
| O₂       | 1           |         |             |

Periodic-table excerpts, taxonomic ladders, comparative species tables,
genetic crosses (Punnett squares) — all as markdown tables. Keep Punnett
squares to 2×2 or 4×4 grids with bold allele labels.

Units: use KaTeX `\\mathrm{}` for unit typesetting in display equations
(e.g. $\\mathrm{m/s^2}$, $\\mathrm{kg \\cdot m^2}$). In inline prose,
Unicode is fine ("9.8 m/s²").

Observation tables and lab data should always be tabular.
"""


_MATHEMATICS_GUIDELINES = """SUBJECT-SPECIFIC — MATHEMATICS:

EVERY mathematical expression goes in KaTeX — inline `$...$` for expressions
that live mid-sentence, display `$$...$$` for expressions on their own line.
This applies to: variables ($x$, $y$), fractions ($\\frac{a}{b}$), powers
($x^2$), roots ($\\sqrt{2}$), integrals, sums, limits, matrices, set
notation, trigonometric functions, logarithms — everything.

Worked solutions: present each step in a numbered list; put the equation
on a display-math line beneath its explanation.

1. Move all $x$ terms to the left-hand side:
   $$3x + 2 = x + 10$$
   $$2x = 8$$
2. Divide both sides by 2:
   $$x = 4$$

Systems of equations, matrix operations, transformations — present the
matrix/system as display math. Proofs (geometric, algebraic, by induction)
use numbered steps where each justification cites a rule or earlier step.

Comparisons of functions, function-value tables, and piecewise definitions
render as markdown tables with right-aligned numeric columns.
"""


_CS_GUIDELINES = """SUBJECT-SPECIFIC — COMPUTER SCIENCE / TECHNOLOGY:

Pseudocode and program listings — fenced code blocks with the language tag
(```python, ```javascript, ```java, ```sql, etc.). Use 4-space indentation;
keep snippets under 20 lines; annotate with inline `# comments`.

Complexity analysis — KaTeX for asymptotic notation ($O(n \\log n)$,
$\\Theta(n^2)$, $\\Omega(n)$). Complexity comparisons as markdown tables:

| Operation | Array | Linked List | Hash Map |
|:----------|:-----:|:-----------:|:--------:|
| Lookup    | $O(1)$ | $O(n)$     | $O(1)$   |
| Insert    | $O(n)$ | $O(1)$     | $O(1)$   |

Truth tables — always as markdown tables with centred columns:
| p | q | p ∧ q | p ∨ q |
|:-:|:-:|:-----:|:-----:|
| T | T | T     | T     |
| T | F | F     | T     |

Data-structure diagrams (trees, graphs, linked lists) — use Mermaid.js
(```mermaid ... ```) for flowcharts and control flow, consistent with
CLAUDE.md content rule §4.

Shell commands in fenced `bash` blocks. Configuration files (JSON, YAML,
TOML) in fenced blocks tagged with the format.

## Architecture diagrams (planned, not yet drafted)

Per the global standard (Rule #17 in `~/coding-standards/CODING_RULES.md`),
this project will eventually maintain a subset of the 11 standard diagrams.
At MVP only diagrams 1–3 are needed:

- [ ] System Design (mobile · backend · Anthropic)
- [ ] Component Diagram (mobile screens · backend modules · vendored pipeline)
- [ ] Service Dependencies (sync HTTP, push via FCM)

Defer diagrams 4–11 until production deployment is in sight.
